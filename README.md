# These Handsome Devils Website

- This is a simple website for a tribute band in Los Angeles that I'm a part of.

## URLs
- https://62fdac0aa3bda147129bb1fc--starlit-nougat-cd25d0.netlify.app/shows
- FrontEnd Repo: https://github.com/Rvelarde83/capstoneTHDangular/tree/master
- Backend Repo: https://github.com/Rvelarde83/backendTHDsite
## Technologies: 

- Angular, TypeScript
- Express, MongoDb, Mongoose, Html, Plain CSS, Heroku.

### The Reason

- The reason to build this webiste was to challenge myself to try to learn Angular, which I liked, and to challenge myself to learn CSS which I've struggled with.


## The Site 

The site features full crud in the next Models:
- Shows
- Bandmates
- Photos 
- The idea is that the site gets to be almost self mantainable so other bandmembers with a user and a password can edit it.
